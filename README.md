- I focused on designing an intuitive user experience with features such as browsing fooditems, adding them to the cart, and placing orders.
- Users could create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. This allowed them tohave personalized experiences, such as saving favorite food items or viewing order history.
- Secure stripe payment gateway for smooth transaction providing a seamless user experience.
